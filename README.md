# CTF Management Server

A CTF management server which is built for orchestrating a distributed CTF.
<br>

This is a central control server which is responsible for handling:
<br>

- Player registration and login
- Managing player state
- Container deployment with working in coordination with worker nodes

## Configuration

There are two configuration files in this system which you have to configure:
<br>

- config.env <br>
  This is the file where all your secrets live; for e.g. database ports, encryption keys. So make sure to configure it properly and ensure to not leak its contents
  <br>

- workernodes.json <br>
  This is the file where all your worker node configuration will live; for e.g. IP address of worker nodes and port on which the worker node is listening to create/delete containers
